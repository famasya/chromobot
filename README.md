# chromobot

Dead simple [Arduino](http://arduino.cc) code editor powered by Johnny-five. Now you can build and debug your board using javascript in chrome! :D

Still depend on Node.js background service due to quick development. I amazed how powerful [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) is. I had to learn deeper into child_process, [Chrome JavaScript API](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/api_index) and [Johnny-Five](http://johnny-five.io) to create my first chrome extension.

Now I can sleep in peace.
